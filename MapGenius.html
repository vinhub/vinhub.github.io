MapGenius

MapGenius (from Redmond Labs) is a fun game designed to help you recover the mapping / navigation skills you lost when you started using Google Maps. 
In the game, you drive around a town and gradually construct its map in your mind. And of course, there are some fun activities / rewards along the way.

MapGenius is currently under development. 
Please stay tuned for updates!
